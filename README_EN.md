# 🌍 Remote Sensing PoC & Portfolio

This repository serves as a portfolio to document learning, prototyping, and reproducible workflows using Google Earth Engine (GEE) and QGIS, with a focus on satellite-based visualization, analysis, and predictive modeling.

---

## 🚀 Vision

The ultimate goal of this repository is to support early warning and decision-making for pressing water-related challenges—such as water resource degradation, flooding, turbidity, droughts, and climate-driven extremes—  
by developing predictive and anomaly detection models.

Rather than using GEE or QGIS as mere visualization or reporting tools,  
this project aims to leverage them for building scalable analysis pipelines for forecasting and diagnostics in the water domain.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

- To create a reproducible learning record of satellite-based analysis using GEE and QGIS  
- To present reliable, verifiable Proof-of-Concept (PoC) for proposal documentation and technical validation  
- To accumulate datasets, scripts, and results for future water modeling and anomaly detection projects

---

## 🛠 Technologies

- Google Earth Engine (JavaScript API)  
- QGIS (open-source GIS and spatial visualization platform)  
- GitHub (documentation, code management, and public sharing)
